# Generic Docker Makefile

Small scripts forked from https://github.com/mvanholsteijn/docker-makefile

To resolve these to issues, I created a generic Makefile that allows you to build and release docker images based upon git tags, whenever you want.

## Makefile targets

The Makefile has the following targets:
```
build                -  builds a new version of your container image
snapshot             -  builds a new version of your container image, and pushes it to the registry

showver              -  shows the current release tag based on the workspace
showimage            -  shows the container image name based on the workspace

tag-patch-release    -  increments the patch release level and create the tag without build
tag-minor-release    -  increments the minor release level and create the tag without build
tag-major-release    -  increments the major release level and create the tag without build

patch-release        -  increments the patch release level, build and push to registry
minor-release        -  increments the minor release level, build and push to registry
major-release        -  increments the major release level, build and push to registry

check-status         -  checks whether there are outstanding changes
check-release        -  checks whether the workspace matches the tagged release in git

help                 -  show this help.
```


## How to use it.
copy the Makefile and .make-release-support into your Docker git project:

```bash
wget -O Makefile.mk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvanholsteijn/docker-makefile/master/Makefile
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvanholsteijn/docker-makefile/master/.make-release-support
```

## Change registry, user or image name
By default, the registry is set to docker.io and the user to the current user. To override this, include
the Makefile as Makefile.mk and set the variables REGISTRY_HOST, USERNAME and NAME.

```Makefile
include Makefile.mk

REGISTRY_HOST=myregistry.io
USERNAME=mvanholsteijn
NAME=awesome-image
```

## Building an image
to build an image, add a Dockerfile to your directory and type make:

```bash
make
```

##  Release
To make a release and tag it, commit add the changes and type:

```bash
make	patch-release
```

This will bump the patch-release number, build the image and push it to the registry. It will only
release if there are no outstanding changes and the content of the directory equals the tagged content.

Alternatively you can choose 'make minor-release' or 'make major-release' to bump the associated number.

## Release number
The release of your docker image is kept in the file .release and uses the following format:

	release=<major>.<minor>.<patch>

The name of the git tag is kept in the same file, and by default will have the format:

	tag=<directory-name>.<minor>.<patch>

This will allow you to have track and tag multiple images in a single Git repository.

If you want to use a different tag prefix, change it in the .release.

## Image name and tag
The name of the image will be created as follows:

```
	<registry-host>/<username>/<directory name>:<tag>
```

The tag is has the following format:

<table >
<tr><th>format</th><th>when</th></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>&lt;release> </td><td>  the contents of the directory is equal to tagged content in git

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top> &lt;release>-&lt;commit> </td><td>  the contents of the directory is not equal to the tagged content
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top> &lt;release>-&lt;commit>-dirty <td> the contents of the directory has uncommitted changes
</td></tr>
</table>

## Multiple docker images in a single git repository.

If you want to maintain multiple docker images in a single git repository, you can use an alternate setup where the Makefile is located in a  silbing directory.

```
├── multiple-example
│   ├── ...
│   ├── image1
│   │   ├── .release
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── Makefile
│   ├── image2
│   │   ├── .release
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── Makefile
│   └── make
│       ├── .make-release-support
│       ├── Makefile
```

The Makefile in the image directories will include the generic Makefile. In this Makefile you can alter the names and tailor the build by adding pre and post build targets.  Checkout the directory (multiple-example) for an example.


## Dependencies between images in a single git repository

You can specify release dependencies between components in the repository using the variable `tag_on_changes_in` in the .release file.

Let's say we have repository:



```
├── release-dependencies
│   ├── ...
│   ├── common
│   │   ├── .release
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── Makefile
│   ├── backend
│   │   ├── .release
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── Makefile
│   ├── frontend
│   │   ├── .release
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── Makefile
│   └── make
│       ├── .make-release-support
│       ├── Makefile
```

and the following dependencies between the releases:

```
  +--------------------------------+
  |                                v
+----------+     +---------+     +--------+
| frontend | --> | backend | --> | common |
+----------+     +---------+     +--------+
```

The respective .release files will have the following configuration:

```
frontend/.release
=================
tag_on_changes_in=. ../backend ../common

backend/.release
=================
tag_on_changes_in=. ../common

```
check-status, check-release and showver will detect that a new version is required if there are changes in either backend or common with respect to the last release tag. Checkout the directory [release-dependencies](./release-dependencies) for an example.

Note that there are a number of caveats:

- the script does not recurse, so you must specify all directories it depends on
- the script does not order the release tagging, so you must release the components in order
- the script does not detect cycles in the dependencies
- the paths must be relative and point to directories in the same git repository


### Create the generic make directory

To create the generic make directory, type:

```bash
mkdir make
cd make
wget  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvanholsteijn/docker-makefile/master/Makefile  
wget  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvanholsteijn/docker-makefile/master/.make-release-support
```

### Create docker image directory
For each docker images, you create a sibling directory:

```bash
mkdir ../image1
cd ../image1

cat > Makefile <<!
include ../make/Makefile

USERNAME=mvanholsteijn

pre-build:
	@echo do some stuff before the docker build

post-build:
	@echo do some stuff after the docker build
!

```

Now you can use the make build and release instructions to build these images.

### Changing the build context and Dockerfile path and name

Use the `DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT`variable to set the path to the context. Set `DOCKER_FILE_PATH` to change the path to the Dockerfile (file name included) you want to use. Using this in conjuction with the `pre-build` and `post-build` targets and a `.dockerignore` file allows you to modify the build context.

```
DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT=../..
DOCKER_FILE_PATH=$(DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT)/docker/$(NAME)/some.Dockerfile

pre-build: check-env-vars .dockerignore
	cp .dockerignore $(DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT)

post-build:
	rm $(DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT)/.dockerignore
```

### pre tag command
If you want add the current release to a source file, you can add the property `pre\_tag\_command` to the .release file. 
this command is executed when the .release file is updated and before the tag is placed. In the command @@RELEASE@@ is
replaced with the current release before it is executed. For example:

```
release=0.1.0
tag=v0.1.0
pre_tag_command=sed -i "" -e 's/^version=.*/version="@@RELEASE@@"/' setup.py
```

### Adding --build-arg
If you want to add any command line options to the docker build command, specify the Make 
variable `DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS`. 

The following Makefile, specifies the build argument `TAG_VERSION` to be set to the current value.

```
include ../Makefile
DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS=--build-arg TAG_VERSION=$(VERSION)
```

checkout the example [Make-](./build-arg-example/Makefile) and [Dockerfile](./build-arg-example/Dockerfile).

### control the :latest tag
You can now control the generation of the latest tag with the variable TAG_WITH_LATEST.

| value | action | removes :latest tag? |
|-------|--------|----------------------|
| always | tag all images with `:latest` | no |
| on-release | only tag clean images tag (eg. x.y.z) with `:latest` | yes, for no-release builds |
| never | never tag with `:latest` | yes |

Caveats:
- when you build a image from an earlier release, it will also be tagged `latest` with `on-release` and `always`.
